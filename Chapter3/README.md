# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Namespaces)

This section is about Namespaces and declaring them. It is pretty much just a page that describes how you can initilize namespaces to make typing code more efficent by either referencing the namespace for that specific function or the namespace as a whole. I remember watching a video about how making a whole file use a namespace is stupid as when you want to scale up your project your going to be running into inconviences in naming and the author also mentions the same thing. So use them but be weary when you rely on them with external libraries. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice> <-- a link for future reference on why this is bad.

## Section 2 (Strings)

This section was about strings and different ways to initilize them. Also String Operators. Not much to say about this since I know so much about strings from java. It's useful for knowing c++ specific terms like .size() instead of .length() and .empty(), which doesn't have a java opposite which is dumb.

## Section 3 (Vectors)

This section is about vectors. Going into it I had no idea how they work and leaving I still had no idea how they worked. It is essentialy an array but not really, maybe a list. One nice thing is that its resizable and would definenty be useful unless that have other sorts of lists, then im probably never going to use this a day in my life. That seems to be the case knowing how I need to type like a whole for loop to add elements to it aswell. Only thing this has going for it is resizabilty.
