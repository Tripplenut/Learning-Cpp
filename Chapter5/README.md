# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Simple Statements)

This section is about statements/lines of code. Useful statements, what a null statement is, how imporant semi-colons are, compound statements. If you have written 100 lines of code you know exactly how it all works.

## Section 2 (Statement Scope)

This section is about the scope of variable. Variables declared in a loop can't be used outside of the loop, variables declared in a class can't be declared outside of that class, (unless you make em public or have a method do so).

## Section 3 (Conditional Statements)

This section is about conditional statements like if and switch that allow for branching of code and determining the flow of programs. If statements are pretty simple to understand. If the codition is met do this... you know. Don't forget braces on the else statements. Switch statementns are a little more complex as there can be multiple branches but usually the code after is short. There is no braces for switch statements and don't forget a break at the end of a case.
