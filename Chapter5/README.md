# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Simple Statements)

This section is about statements/lines of code. Useful statements, what a null statement is, how important semi-colons are, compound statements. If you have written 100 lines of code, you know exactly how it all works.

## Section 2 (Statement Scope)

This section is about the scope of variables. Variables declared in a loop can't be used outside of the loop, variables declared in a class can't be declared outside of that class (unless you make them public or have a method do so).

## Section 3 (Conditional Statements)

This section is about conditional statements like if and switch that allow for branching of code and determining the flow of programs. If statements are pretty simple to understand. If the condition is met, do this... you know. Don't forget braces on the else statements. Switch statements are a little more complex as there can be multiple branches but usually, the code after is short. There are no braces for switch statements, and don't forget a break at the end of a case.

## Section 4 (Iterative Statements)

This section is about iterative statements, so while, do-while, for, and for each statement. This is a little off-topic, but today was the day I realized that vectors were actually not that hard to understand and actually way better than arrays since it is like a built-in ArrayList okay, now back to iterative statements. While and For loops are basic, do-while is just a while loop but with a do at the start, so it runs the code once and will run it again if the while condition is true. For each is not for data manipulation but more finding similarities or values inside of data as it completely goes through each index of an array, matrix, map, etc. Essential section and examples of them all in the file.

## Section 5 (Jump Statements)

This section is about jump statements. In the words of the author, "jump statements interrupt the flow of execution," so these are specifically for loops and iterations so you can skip over, stop and return (returns are gone over in a future section). Break statements that we saw in switch statements stop loops, continue statements go to the next iteration of code, and goto statements literally jump over blocks of code.

## Section 6 (Exception Handling)

I have not done much with exception handling previous to this. Only when using external repos or a database, but even then, it was nothing crazy, so this is definitely a nice chapter for learning the actual usage and meaning of exception handling. It's kind of hard to force an error, so I just explained everything in the file.

## End of Chapter Notes

Like I seem to say at the end of every chapter, this was the most useful so far. Learning some core programming knowledge. Even though it is just basic stuff when it really comes down to it. The make up of all the complex is just the simple, you just gotta put the pieces together in different ways. That shit sounded so corny that I could not end it off on that note. Section 7 gg.
