# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Simple Statements)

This section is about statements/lines of code. Useful statements, what a null statement is, how imporant semi-colons are, compound statements. If you have written 100 lines of code you know exactly how it all works.

## Section 2 (Statement Scope)

This section is about the scope of variable. Variables declared in a loop can't be used outside of the loop, variables declared in a class can't be declared outside of that class, (unless you make em public or have a method do so).
