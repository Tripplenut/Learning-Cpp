# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Simple Statements)

This section is about statements/lines of code. Useful statements, what a null statement is, how imporant semi-colons are, compound statements. If you have written 100 lines of code you know exactly how it all works.

## Section 2 (Statement Scope)

This section is about the scope of variable. Variables declared in a loop can't be used outside of the loop, variables declared in a class can't be declared outside of that class, (unless you make em public or have a method do so).

## Section 3 (Conditional Statements)

This section is about conditional statements like if and switch that allow for branching of code and determining the flow of programs. If statements are pretty simple to understand. If the codition is met do this... you know. Don't forget braces on the else statements. Switch statementns are a little more complex as there can be multiple branches but usually the code after is short. There is no braces for switch statements and don't forget a break at the end of a case.

## Section 4 (Iterative Statements)

This section is about iterative statements, so while, do while, for, and for each statements. This is a little off topic but today was the day I realized that vectors were actually not that hard to understand and actually way better than arrays since it is like a built-in arrayList okay now back to iterative statements. While and For loops are basic, do while is just a while loop but with a do at the start so it runs the code once and will run it again if the while condition is true. For each is not for data manipulation but more finding similaries or values inside of data as it completely goes through each index of an array,matrix,map,etc. Essential Section and examples of them all in the file.

## Section 5 (Jump Statements)

This section is about jump statements. In the words of the author "jump statements interrupt the flow of execution", so these are specifically for loops and iterations so you can skip over, stop and return (returns are gone over in a future section). Break statements which we saw in switch statements stop loops, continute statements go to the next iteration of code, and goto statements literally jump over blocks of code.
