# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Function Basics)

This section is about functions and how they work. Big method guy. Functions are an essential part to any program. If you don't want to put all your code in one big ass file and want to automate things just a little bit, which is the whole point of object oriented programming you use functions. There are some built in like sizeof and you can make your own like the factorial method in the file. They also have a scope. They can be fixed to a file or object. To use an objects functions you just gotta create an object and call the function and to use a files you need to import it to you main file and call it in main.
