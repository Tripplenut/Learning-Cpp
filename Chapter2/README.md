# Chapter Notes

## Section 1

This section was about the built in types of primitives in C++. It goes over boolean, characters, integers, and floats. Breifly goes over machine-level representation of these concepts in bits and bytes but if anything it just makes the section more confusing. They also go over signed types which makes the section extra confusing. It began to make more sense once it went over floating-point types and how it is more efficent to use a double instead of a float due to how most calculations will use 10 or more significant digits.
