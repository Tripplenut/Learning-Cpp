# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Primitive Types)

This section was about the built in types of primitives in C++. It goes over boolean, characters, integers, and floats. Breifly goes over machine-level representation of these concepts in bits and bytes but if anything it just makes the section more confusing. They also go over signed types which makes the section extra confusing. It began to make more sense once it went over floating-point types and how it is more efficent to use a double instead of a float due to how most calculations will use 10 or more significant digits.

## Section 2 (Primitive Types Part 2)

This section goes over booleans, chars, escape characters, how strings are arrays of chars, and String Concatentation, and multiline literal. None of it is something I don't already know but other than the list of escape characters. Overall a solid chapter but there was no code to write.

## Section 3 (References and Pointers)

I took a long break (about a week) and to be honest I've been skimming chapters since there was such a similarity to Java but now I'm actually reading this book word for word. This section goes over reference object and how if you define a variable you can assign another variable to it as a reference. Go to the code for this section for a more indepth way to see how to use. This section also goes over pointers and how it is an indirect way to refer to variabls and objects while references are a direct way. To be honest I don't understand pointers and even the author acknowledges how hard they are to understand. I would come back to this section or topic at a later time when I understand how useful addresses of objects are.

## Section 4 (Const)

This section is about the keyword const which we can put before a variable or object to show that we want it unchanged. const for constant since something that is constant is unchanging. Every thing about a const variable and a regular variable is the same the only difference is that a const variable can't be changed ever, so things like pi, euler's number, or the golden ratio. The section goes over references and pointers relations to consts as well. It seems like a useful tool for things that don't change, I don't know if it's beneficial in the aspect of storage or memory or maybe just for remembering that a certain value should never change.

## Section 5 (Type aliases)

This section is about type aliases and other types that help automate or shorten code. To be honest this was one of the biggest missing parts to me with Java. I rememeber coding a game on roblox like 2 years ago and it was in lua, it has type aliases and I thought it was the most useful thing ever. It could be the game engine and not the actual language but either way refering to something complex but shortened will always be useful. The section also goes over auto types and decltype which both I barely understand.

## ngg(Number Guessing Game)

I whipped this one up during physics in school. Just so I could put some of the skills to the test. I can now put C++ developer on my resume.
