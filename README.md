# Learning C++

## Mission Statement

This is really just a repo for me to document my progress with learning c++. It's not really for anyone besides myself, so if you are a person cruising through my repo's hello c:

With that said All the folder/files in this project is based of the chapters and sections of C++ Primer by Stanely B. Lippamn, which is also what I am using to learn the language (Youtube vids just couldn't cut it). I am going to try and do about a section a day and put some notes on the markdown for that specific chapter.
