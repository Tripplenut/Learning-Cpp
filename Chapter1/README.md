# Chapter Notes

## Section 1

So this is the first section of the book. It goes over how to begin writing code in C++ and how to execute programs. Since I've already picked up Java, this isn't too difficult to understand. The goal of this entire chapter seems to be, from what I've read so far, creating a program that reads ISBN strings and converting it into some sort of function that calculates something. It also goes into detail about the importance of semi-colons, file naming conventions, and running files from the command line.

## Section 2

This section is about inputs and outputs. Let me just say inputting stuff on Java is ten times more painful than it is with C++. Some key concepts of this section were initializing variables, writing and reading from the stream, as well as importing libraries. It goes over the libraries briefly as it's only really needed for the inputs and outputs. This section briefly goes over debugging and how print statements are useful for seeing when code breaks or when certain functions are called.

## Section 3

This section was comments. Just comments. Commenting is important when trying to make readable code, but you also don't want to overdo it. No comments are better than wrong comments, so when updating code, make sure you either fix the comments or remove them. It is also generally safer to refer to comments instead of documentation as sometimes documentation can be out of date, but the comments will always be, at least as long as the programmer follows the rule of updating it.

## Section 4

This section was about while loops, for loops, and if-else statements. It goes over how code is read from top to bottom. Whatever appears first is read before everything else. While loops repeat code multiple times and require a condition to run, if the condition is true, then the loop runs until the condition is false. For loops are like while loops as they repeat code but a set number of times. The formatting is similar but condensed. It is variable(integer), condition(boolean), and incrementing the variable. Both While loop and For loops help you repeat code for things like traversing arrays, algorithms, and checking individual characters. If Else Statements are self-explanatory. "If" this happens, do this, "Else" do this. I would've added the code for If Else statements, but I know them well enough already from java. So far, almost all of this is just a review, but it is nice to see there are plenty of similarities between C++ and Java, like concatenation, primitive naming, and syntax.

## Section 5

This section is about importing and calling classes as well as using methods within them. I read the chapter twice, and to be honest, it was a horrible explanation of how classes themselves work, and the book doesn't seem to go over classes in full until the 12th chapter. There is no example of creating your own class, and to be honest, I think it is literally like making your main method but just naming the main the class name as well as changing the file name to .hpp/.h instead of .cpp/.c Pretty confusing compared to java, but I will try to go out of my way to pick it up soon. I looked up how classes worked to make the section 5 file btw, see that if you want some info on classes.

## Section 6

This section was for solving a problem given in the first sections. It doesn't really go over anything but instead just combines all the previous sections into one main large piece of code, which is also missing a whole class that solves whatever problem the author wanted to be solved. Kinda useless, but thankfully, it's not much as I really didn't want to read.

## End of Chapter Notes

Overall this chapter was an introduction to the language of C++. I learned a lot about the language and its similarities to ones I already know, like java. I see why people consider this language as hard to learn, but luckily it doesn't seem to be too overwhelming to me â€” looking forward to the rest of the chapters!
