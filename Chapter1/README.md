# Chapter Notes

## Section 1

So this is the first section of the first section of the book. It goes over how to begin writing code in C++ and how to execute programs. Since I've already picked up Java this isn't too dificult to understand. The goal of this entire chapter seems to be, from what I've read so far, creating a program that reads ISBN strings and converting it into some sort of function that calculates somthing. It also goes into detail about the importance of semi-colons, file naming conventions, and running files from the command line.

## Section 2

This chapter is about inputs and outputs. Let me just say, inputting stuff on Java is 10 times more painful then it is with C++. Some key concepts of this section was initializing variables, writing and reading from the stream, as well as importing libraries. It goes over the libraries briefly as its only really needed for the inputs and outputs. This section breifly goes over debugging and how print statements are useful for seeing when code breaks or when certain function are called.

## Section 3

This chapter was comments. Just comments. Commenting is important when trying to make readable code but you also don't want to overdue it. No comments is better than wrong comments so when updating code make sure you either fix the comments or remove them. It is also generally safer to refer to comments instead of documentation as sometimes documentation can be out of date but the comments will always be, at least as long as the programmer follows the rule of updating it.

## Section 4

This chapter was about while loops, for loops, and if else statements.  It goes over how code is read from top to bottom. What ever appears first is read before everything else. While loops repeat code multiple times and require a condition to to run, if the condition is true then the loop runs until the condition is false. For loops are like while loops as they repeat code but a set number of times. The formatting is similar but condensed. It is variable(integer), condition(boolean), and incrimenting the variable. Both While loop and For loops help you repeat code for things like traversing arrays, algorithms, and checking individual characters. If Else Statements are self explanitory. "If" this happens do this, "Else" do this. I would've added the code for If Else statements but I know them well enough already from java. So far almost all of this is just review but it is nice to see there are plenty of similaries between C++ and Java like concatination, primitive naming, and syntax.
