# Chapter Notes

## Section 1

So this is the first section of the first section of the book. It goes over how to begin writing code in C++ and how to execute programs. Since I've already picked up Java this isn't too dificult to understand. The goal of this entire chapter seems to be, from what I've read so far, creating a program that reads ISBN strings and converting it into some sort of function that calculates somthing. It also goes into detail about the importance of semi-colons, file naming conventions, and running files from the command line.

## Section 2

This chapter is about inputs and outputs. Let me just say, inputting stuff on Java is 10 times more painful then it is with C++. Some key concepts of this section was initializing variables, writing and reading from the stream, as well as importing libraries. It goes over the libraries briefly as its only really needed for the inputs and outputs. This section breifly goes over debugging and how print statements are useful for seeing when code breaks or when certain function are called.

## Section 3

This chapter was comments. Just comments. Commenting is important when trying to make readable code but you also don't want to overdue it. No comments is better than wrong comments so when updating code make sure you either fix the comments or remove them. It is also generally safer to refer to comments instead of documentation as sometimes documentation can be out of date but the comments will always be, at least as long as the programmer follows the rule of updating it.
