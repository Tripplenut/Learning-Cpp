# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Fundementals)

This section is about the basic concepts of operators and operands. I knew pretty much all of this from Java. It's really just what order math is done in, which is PEMDAS, of course, using parentheses for altering that order and stuff.

## Section 2 (Arithmetic Operators)

This section is about math operators like +,-,*,/, and %. I know all of this from Java, so this chapter wasn't even a refresher it was kind of just reassurance that the operators between Java and c++ are the same. The less I got to remember!

## Section 3 (Logic Operators)

This section is about logical operators for bools and other true or false statements. So ya know !,<,<=,>,>=,==,!=,&&, and ||. This was the same as the arithmetic operators as they are all the same as the ones in Java, so I didn't need to learn anything new or remember a new type or something.

## Section 4 (Assignment Operators)

This section is about assignment operators and how you can assign values to variables and objects. It is the same as in Java, you can't assign expressions to a value, you cant assign a value to a number, and it goes over other ways to initialize variables like var1 = var2 = var3 with var3 being some type of prim data type or object. There is also a really convenient way to make a while loop condition easier to understand. Check the file for that.

## Section 5 (Increment and Decrement Operators)

This section is about easy and convenient ways to increase and decrease the values of ints, longs, floats, and doubles. It is just the ++ and -- operand. I picked this one up in Java, but in case you somehow forgot it pick it up, or if by some chance you are a random person reading this, definitely pick this one up.

## Section 6 (Member Access Operators)

This section is about the different ways you can access members/methods/functions of an object. The two ways to do this is with "->" which is the least popular way. I've only ever seen this used with lambda expressions. The other being the dot or ".". This way is more recognizable, but when you are calling multiple methods, it looks pretty ugly.

## Section 7 (Conditional Operators)

This is about the conditional operator that allows you to shorten the length of an if-else statement. I recently found out about this function while doing leetcode problems. The formating is var = cond ? expr1 : expr2. If the condition is true, it sets var to expr1 else var is set to expr2. Check the file to see it in action. Pretty useful and easy to read.

## Section 8 (Bitwise Operators)

This section is about bitwise operators, so ~, <<, \>\>, &, |, and ^. I don't really know anything about this, and even after reading the chapter, I have no clue. It kind of takes the binary value of variables and allows you to alter, flip, and combine them in different ways. This is definitely a horrible explanation, but in the future, I hope this makes sense.

## Section 9 (sizeof Operator)

This section is about the function sizeof. I've used it a few times to get the length of strings and array and to be honest, I don't like how it works, but it works, and that's all that matters. Check the file for initialization and examples.

## Section 10 (Comma Operator)

This section is about using commas to extend the usage of a previous piece of code. Its most commonly used when initializing variables but can also be used in loops. Check the file to see its usage in loops.

## Section 11 (Type Conversions)

This section is about type conversions. So turning integer into floats, expressions into booleans, and concatenating. C++ already does most of that for you, but there are certain ways to assure you won't get errors when trying to do it yourself. Check the file for examples. This is definitely one of the most useful chapters I have come across as type conversion was something I never learned fully in Java and was definitely the source of countless errors.

## Section 12 (Table of expressions)

It was two pages going over every operator used in the chapter and in future ones.

## LO / Lexicographic order

After reading chapter 11, I had to try and make my own little function that automatically sorts the characters into strings lexicographically. It's obviously not perfect as I whipped it up in 15 minutes, and it probably breaks if you input white space other than that, it should work. I also used selection sort as I am way too lazy to use merge, insertion, or any other decent sorting algorithm.

## End of Chapter Notes

This chapter was pretty light until the end when I started to get some new and useful information. It was like a quick review of all the operators I learned in Java, and I can assume the operators in other languages will be roughly the same as well. Thinking about picking up Kotlin after I finish this language and make a few projects, but aside from me rambling on about the future, this is a chapter I will most likely come back to a few times each time I get an error I can understand, or I forgot how sizeof works lol.
