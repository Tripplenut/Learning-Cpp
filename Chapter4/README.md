# Chapter Notes

## Section 1 (Fundementals)

This section is about the basic concepts of operators and operands. I knew pretty much all of this from java. Its really just what order math is done in which is pemdas of course, using parentheses for altering that order and stuff.

## Section 2 (Arithmetic Operators)

This section is about math operators like +,-,*,/, and %. I know all of this from java so this chapter wasn't even a refresher it was kind of just reassurance that the operators between java and c++ is the same. The less I got to remember!

## Section 3 (Logic Operators)

This section is about logical operators for bools and other true or false statement. So ya know !,<,<=,>,>=,==,!=,&&, and ||. This was the same as teh arithmatic operators as they are all the same as the ones in java so I don't need to learn anything knew or remember a new type or something.

## Section 4 (Assignment Operators)

This section is about assignment operators and how you can assign values to variables and objects. It is the same as in java, you can't assign expressions to a value, you cant assign a value to a number, and it goes over other ways to initilize variables like var1 = var2 = var3 with var3 being some type of prim data type or object. There is also a really convenient way to make a while loop condition easier to understand. Check the file for that.
